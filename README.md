## Web Scraper (Scrapy) - Online Reviews/Ratings of Organic Coffee

This repository contains the web scraper I used to crawl the Utopia.de website to collect online user reviews of organic/fair trade coffee.

The dataset is available on Kaggle

### Content
The scraper will collect the following data:
- brand name of the coffee being reviewed
- user rating of the coffee (1-5 stars)

### Inspiration
This one is a little small, but should be enough to try out some sentiment analysis and other advancesd techniques like aspect-based sentiment analysis. It would be interesting to extract features that represent the preferences of coffee drinkers, why they chose to buy organic/fair trade coffee brands over conventional ones, and maybe even find out what differentiates a 5-star coffee from 'just' a 4-star coffee.
